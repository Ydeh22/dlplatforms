# Deep Learning Platforms in Food Recognition
In this project it is developed a new system exploiting commercial deep learning platforms, for image content predictions. A case study of food type and ingredients identification.

### Deep Learning based platforms
- Vision AI (https://cloud.google.com/vision/)
- ClarifAI (https://clarifai.com)
- Amazon Rekognition (https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/)
- IBM Watson Visual Recognition (https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/visual-recognition/)

### Requirements
- PHP_Compat-1.6.0a3
- PHP API libraries for each platform, which can be found in owners repositories.
- PHP version 7.3
- Composer (https://getcomposer.org)

### Android application
The android application was developed with mit appinventor (https://appinventor.mit.edu).
You can find the apk as well as the project file in [android](android) folder

### Short evaluation dataset
The [Food120](Food120) folder contains the shor dataset for the evaluation of the platforms. For further details read [this](Food120/Readme.md).
